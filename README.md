# flask-vue-crud

A simple CRUD(create, read, update, delete) site that uses a python flask backend and a Vue.js front end. The site has three books imported by deafault and users can add new ones, update existing ones, and delete them as well. The code is NOT DEPLOYED and is for learning purposes only.

# Requirements for using
- Python
- Node
- Vue.js

# How to use
1. Clone down the repository.
2. CD into client directory.
3. Run npm install to install required modules.
4. Start up the python flask server in a new window by navigating to server directory and running 'python app.py'.
5. In the client directory run 'npm run serve' (if there is a compile error try running with a '--fix' at the end of the command).
6. The server should be running on 'http://localhost:5000' and the site itself on 'http://localhost:8080'.
